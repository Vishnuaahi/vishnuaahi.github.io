                <h2>Sugarcane Juice</h2>
                <p>Think of summer season and the drinks that come to mind are wood apple, mango, and sugarcane.
                     While the former two are known for their benefits, but the latter one is often neglected. 
                     But the fact is, the humble sugarcane juice is loaded with health benefits.
                     All you need to take care of is the hygiene level and quantity of juice you consume and you
                     are set to fight the heat efficiently.
                     Amino acids found in sugarcane juice helps balance the stress hormone levels and also
                     induces sleep. Regular consumption of fresh juice also provides relief from insomnia.
                     Sugarcane juice is filled with dietary fiber that binds with fat and prevents overeating.
                     On one hand, the alkaline nature helps easy fat-burning, while on the other hand, the high 
                     natural sugar content stimulates calorie-burning. Sounds unbelievable? But it's true!
                     The presence of dietary fibre helps stimulate peristaltic motion, control inflammation
                     and relieve symptoms of constipation and bloating.
                     According to various health studies, drinking raw sugarcane juice helps lower overall 
                     cholesterol levels that further prevent cardiovascular diseases.
                     Sugarcane juice is loaded with nutrients like calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium, and 
                     manganese. According to health experts, regular consumption of fresh juice helps to
                     strengthen the bones and also prevents the development of osteoporosis.
                     It has minerals like calcium and phosphorus that protect the enamel of teeth, fight
                     against decay, and strengthen the teeth.
                     All thanks to low glycemic index, consuming sugarcane juice during pregnancy helps
                     boost metabolism, digestion and also provides instant energy throughout the day.
                     Enriched with natural sugar, this juice is an ultimate choice to rehydrate the body 
                     and stave off fatigue. It also helps regulate the release of glucose in the body for 
                     a healthy “sugar high.”
                     It contains alpha hydroxy acids, which is linked to antioxidant effects on the skin. 
                     Regular consumption of fresh juice can clear up skin inflammation and allergies caused 
                     due to hot climatic conditions.
                     Loaded with potassium, fresh sugarcane juice helps reduce tension in blood vessels and
                     arteries, and thus controls blood pressure, erosclerosis and chances of heart attacks.

                <h2>Watermelon Juice</h2>
                <p>Watermelons owe their gorgeous red color to the powerful antioxidant lycopene, just like tomatoes.
                 In recent years, lycopene has being recognized by the scientific community as an especially important
                 nutrient for cardiovascular health. The consumption of lycopene-rich foods, like watermelon, have been
                 connected to an improvement in blood flow by acting as a vasodilator and have shown some ability to 
                 potentially lower LDL, aka bad cholesterol, making lycopene doubly good for your heart.
                 Another benefit of lycopene-rich foods is that they improve bone health by reducing oxidative stress, 
                 which can lead to bone problems, among other health issues. Recent studies have shown that lycopene 
                 may provide an alternative natural treatment for the prevention and management of osteoporosis,
                 especially in post-menopausal women.Watermelon is also a great source of citrulline, a nonessential
                 alpha-amino acid that has been shown to enhance the utilization of essential amino acids during exercise
                 and increase blood flow. Consider including watermelon in your pre and post workout routines as it can 
                 reduce recovery time after exercise and help further increase growth hormone levels after resistance 
                 training.Your body naturally converts the citrulline found in watermelon into arginine in the kidneys.
                 There is some preliminary evidence from animal studies that shows that the conversion of citrulline
                 into arginine may help prevent excess accumulation of fat in fat cells, which is always a good thing.
                 As its name would suggest, watermelon is full of water… shocking! But in addition to that water, this 
                 fruit is also a good source of electrolytes which help you to stay hydrated and replace the minerals 
                 that are lost when you sweat.Watermelon is a good source of potassium, which is absolutely essential
                 for our bodies to function properly. Among other things, low potassium levels can lead to mental fogginess
                 and confusion because, without adequate levels of this extremely important mineral, the electrical signals 
                 that drive the brain are interrupted.
